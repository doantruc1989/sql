A meat-free diet can lead to better health for several reasons.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that many people who follow a vegetarian diet tend to consume a high proportion of fresh, healthful, plant-based foods, which provide antioxidants and fiber. When a person decides to follow a meat-free diet, they often become more active in making overall healthy choices.\r\n\r\nMany studies agree that a vegetarian diet can offer a range of health benefits.\r\n\r\nStudies show that a vegan or vegetarian diet may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and various types of cancer.\r\n\r\nA non-meat diet may also reduceTrusted Source the risk of metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 2019 Gallup poll, 5% of people in the United States describe themselves as vegetarian, including 2% of people aged 55 and over, 8% of those aged 18–34 years, and 7% of people aged 35–54.\r\n\r\nThis article will focus on the lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, which includes dairy products and eggs.\r\n\r\nClick here to learn about some other popular diets.\r\n\r\nWhat foods do vegetarians eat?\r\nVICTOR TORRES/Stocksy\r\nA vegetarian diet can provide a wide variety of healthful, nutritious foods, but what the person eats will depend on the type of diet they are following and their personal food choices.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of diets that come under the umbrella term vegetarian:\r\n\r\nLacto-ovo-vegetarians avoid both meat and fish but consume dairy and eggs.\r\nLacto-vegetarians consume dairy products but no eggs.\r\nOvo-vegetarians consume eggs but no dairy.\r\nSome people who do not eat meat will eat fish. This is a pescatarian diet, rather than a vegetarian diet.\r\n\r\nA vegan diet excludes all animal-based foods.\r\n\r\nPeople following a vegetarian diet must make careful choices about what they eat to ensure that they meet their nutritional requirements. Some people may need supplements.\r\n\r\nFor more science-backed resources on nutrition, visit our dedicated hub.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\nA growing number of younger people are adopting a vegetarian diet, as the Gallup poll shows.\r\n\r\nThey may do this because:\r\n\r\nit brings health benefits\r\nit is a more ecologically sustainable option\r\nthey have concerns about the treatment of animals\r\nit is part of a broader lifestyle choice\r\nSome people also avoid meat and animal products for religious reasons.\r\n\r\nHere are some ways in which avoiding meat products can enhance a person’s health.\r\n\r\nWeight: Switching to a vegetarian diet may help a person lose weight, at least in the short-term, according to a 2016 meta-analysisTrusted Source. Scientists need to carry out longer term controlled studies to understand how a vegetarian diet might affect weight.\r\n\r\nCholesterol: A systematic reviewTrusted Source published in 2015 concluded that people who follow a vegetarian diet are likely to have lower overall cholesterol levels.\r\n\r\nCancer: A studyTrusted Source of data for nearly 70,000 people found evidence that the incidence of cancer overall was lower among vegetarians than non-vegetarians. The authors suggested that a non-meat diet may offer some protection from cancer.\r\n\r\nHeart health: Authors of a 2014 studyTrusted Source found a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in people who followed a vegetarian diet in India. Studies in western countries had already produced similar results.\r\n\r\nDiabetes: People who follow a vegetarian diet may be less likelyTrusted Source to have type 2 diabetes. One reason for this may be a higher intake of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts, and a lower intake of unhealthful fats.\r\n\r\nThese benefits will not automatically happen when a person stops eating meat. Alongside a vegetarian diet, people need to make sure they:\r\n\r\nget the right number of calories\r\nfocus on a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains\r\nlimit their intake of processed foods and alcohol\r\navoid unhealthful fats and added sugar and salt\r\nengage in an overall healthful lifestyle, with plenty of exercise\r\navoid smoking\r\nWhat are the health benefits of a vegan diet?\r\n\r\nSustainability\r\nIn addition to the health benefits, experts say a plant-based diet is more sustainable, as it causes less harm to the environment than a meat-based diet.\r\n\r\nWhat else makes a diet sustainable? Find out here.\r\n\r\nTips for getting started\r\nHere are some tips for switching to a vegetarian diet:\r\n\r\nStart learning about the nutrients required and how to obtain them.\r\nGet some tips and recipes from vegetarian websites, a local health food shop, or a nutritionist.\r\nMake a weekly shopping and meal plan.\r\nFocus on a variety of meat-free dishes that provide a complete protein, so that you do not end up eating as before but just leaving out the meat.\r\nConsider making the change gradually, for example, over a month.\r\nStart with familiar meat-free foods, such as mac and cheese and salad, and add to your repertoire over time.\r\nA gradual change may work better for two reasons:\r\n\r\nIt is more likely to become a lifestyle and a long-term move.\r\n\r\nSudden dietary changes, such as an increase in the consumption of beans or vegetables, might lead to temporary digestive problems, such as bloating.\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics have a range of tips for people who want to stop eating meat:\r\n\r\nChoose whole grain products, such as whole wheat bread, wild or brown rice, and whole grain cereals, as these can provide B vitamins.\r\n\r\nVary the diet, with whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and so on.\r\n\r\nUse eggs and dairy products in moderation, or try adding soy milk.\r\n\r\nAsk a healthcare professional about supplements, especially vitamin B-12.\r\n\r\nEnsure a sufficient intake of vitamin D, especially if exposure to sunlight is low.\r\n\r\nCheck the labels of “healthful” vegetarian snacks to ensure they do not contain a lot of sugar, salt, or other additives.\r\n\r\nRemember that junk food and fast food can be unhealthful and high in calories, whether they are vegetarian or not.\r\n\r\nThey also suggest reducing the intake of high sugar and high fat foods.\r\n\r\nLearn more here about how to get started on a plant-based diet.', 'People following a vegetarian diet do not eat meat or fish but may continue to eat eggs and dairy products.', '2022-12-19 14:24:54.474853'),

Whether it’s pizzas, burgers, ready-meals, pastries or sauces, many are low on nutrients and packed with hidden salt, sugar and unsaturated fats.Worse still, the addictive nature of these foods has us coming back for more. No wonder so many of us struggle with our health and weight.Most of us realise by now that cooking from fresh is better for us and is the only way to get back control over what we eat. But the latest science suggests that it can also hardwire the brain to eat healthier and wean us off our addiction to junk food.You may be tired of hearing that you should cook from scratch – particularly if you are pushed for time and money (though remember there is a reason why junk food tends to be so cheap!). The reality is, few of us can manage it all the time if we want any sort of life outside the kitchen.But if you’re looking for a health boost, the science suggests that reducing your reliance on unhealthy processed foods could work better than the latest diet or health fad.reducing your reliance on unhealthy processed foodsHere are three reasons why fresh is best:You can pack more of a nutrient punchYou can boost your health even further with a rainbow on your plate. A daily fix of different coloured fruit and vegetables will help give you pretty much all the antioxidants, vitamins and minerals you need – with the reward of an even healthier you at the end of the rainbow.It hardwires your brain to eat healthierOften people who start cooking their own food say they couldn’t go back to convenience meals. And one small study offers a possible reason why.Researchers at Harvard compared two groups of people – one on a six-month healthy eating and weight-loss programme and the other with no access to the programme.For people in the healthy eating group, MRI scans after six months showed the brain’s reward centres were stimulated more by images of healthy food – and less by images of unhealthy, high calorie food – compared to the group who hadn’t been on the programme.So it may be that by replacing the junk with real food, you can re-programme your brain towards desiring healthier treats than ‘hurry curries’ and chocolate eclairs.You’re less likely to gorge on foods that are bad for youStudies suggest that eating fresh, healthy food triggers an in-built cue in the brain to eat a varied and balanced diet.Research on rats showed that when they had overeaten a healthy food, the brain stopped responding to it – protecting them against overeating and encouraging them to try different foods.But rats fed on processed foods such as pies, cakes, dumplings and cookies, didn’t stop responding to cues for this type of food. They happily continued with their addictive junk-food diet – despite it being higher in calories, lower in nutrients and causing a 10% weight gain.So replacing unhealthy processed foods, such as pizza and burgers, with healthy meals you prepare yourself could reactivate your body’s natural mechanism to eat better. Plus you’re less likely to gorge yourself on foods that are bad for you and your waistline.Stick with itIf all this sounds a lot of effort, the good news is that studies suggest it can get easier with time. So stick with it, and before you know it,  the thought of your lovely stir-fry or homemade soup could be just the incentive you need to skip the ready meal aisle of the supermarket and opt for buying fresh instead.And if shortage of time is the issue, don’t forget there is such a thing as real, fast food. Witness the swathe of recipe books by celebrity chefs designed to help us whip up instant meals from fresh ingredients, and still have time to watch the latest episode of War and Peace!So if you’re looking for lasting improvements to your health and weight, ditch the junk and explore the delights of real, fast food.', 'Fresh food is kind on the waistline and hardwires the brain to eat healthier', '2022-12-19 14:24:54.474853'),

S_E/Shutterstock\r\nCow\'s milk is a good source of important proteins, vitamins, and minerals, licensed and registered dietitian Lauren Smith told Insider.\r\n\r\nOne cup of cow\'s milk provides around 8 grams of protein in addition to high amounts of calcium and vitamin D.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, it also contains lactose, so if you\'re sensitive to it, it\'s best to look for an alternative.\r\n\r\nAlmond milk is a decent option for those on the keto diet.\r\nPortion Sizes 1 Almonds\r\nAlmond milk is generally low in fat. Hollis Johnson\r\nUnsweetened almond milk is a great choice for anyone following a low-carb or ketogenic (keto) diet, according to Smith.\r\n\r\nIt\'s usually low in calories, sugar, and fat, and it\'s fortified with antioxidants.\r\n\r\nBut almond milk is also low in protein.\r\n\r\nOat milk gives you an added boost of fiber.\r\nOat milk\r\nOat milk is high in carbohydrates.

Flickr / Kari Söderholm\r\nPea milk can have just as much protein as cow\'s milk, and it has a creamy texture that other nondairy options often lack. It\'s also typically fairly high in potassium.\r\n\r\nBut whether or not you choose pea milk might have something to do with your taste buds.\r\n\r\nAs registered dietitian Matthew Ruscigno wrote for Today\'s Dietitian, it sometimes has "a beany or grassy flavor."\r\n\r\nIn terms of nutrients, soy milk is the closest equivalent to cow\'s milk.\r\nsoy\r\nSoy milk is a good post-workout option.

It contains 8 grams per cup — the same as cow\'s milk — and is considered a heart-healthy food for those at risk of cardiovascular diseases.\r\n\r\nCoconut milk is a low-calorie, nondairy option.\r\ncoconut milk\r\nCoconut milk is low in calories but high in fat.

Shutterstock\r\nIf you\'re looking for a nondairy milk that tastes like cow\'s milk, macadamia-nut milk could be your best option — as long as you\'re not allergic to tree nuts. \r\n\r\nThough it\'s a bit pricier than most other varieties, it has a subtle buttery, nutty flavor.\r\n\r\nIt\'s also high in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, according to Marin.\r\n\r\nRice milk is good for those with multiple allergies or sensitivities.\r\nbrown rice white rice\r\nRice milk may raise your blood-sugar levels. 4kodiak/Getty Images\r\nRice milk is a good option for people with multiple food sensitivities, such as those allergic to nuts, dairy, and soy.\r\n\r\nBut it offers little nutritional value, since it is mainly rice starch mixed with water, and it may raise blood-sugar levels, according to Marin.\r\n\r\nCashew milk is a great low-calorie, dairy-free alternative.\r\ncashews\r\nCashew milk is low in carbs. iStock\r\nCashew milk is low in calories, carbs, and sugar, and it\'s usually fortified with calcium and vitamin D.
